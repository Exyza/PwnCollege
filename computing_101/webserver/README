This is a very simple webserver, written in x86_64 assembly.

It uses the nasm assembler, and the default GNU linker.

To create a valid executable, run the following commands in the same directory as the webserver.asm file:
  nasm -g -f elf64 -o file1.o file1.asm # Assemble with debug symbols
  ld -o file1 file1.o -g  # Link while preserving debug symbols
