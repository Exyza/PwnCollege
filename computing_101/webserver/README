This is a very simple webserver, written in x86_64 assembly.

It uses the nasm assembler, and the default GNU linker.

To create a valid executable, run the following commands in the same directory as the webserver.asm file:
  nasm -g -f elf64 -o webserver3.o webserver3.s # Assemble with debug symbols
  ld -o webserver3 webserver3.o -g  # Link while preserving debug symbols
